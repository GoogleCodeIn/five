# Five
Just gives you five. In the cloud!

Five is *FaaS* (Five As A Service) and aims to help *make the world a better place*.  Although we are currently a startup, we are *100% webscale* and therefore powered with MongoDB and have a more complex infra setup than Wikimedia (TM).

Five is currently accepted into YCombinator 2016 Summer batch.  We will focus on monotisation to facilitate more world changing SaaS.

# Updates

* Rebranded due to regulations.  Now named "the int more than 4 and less than 6".

* Unfortunatly, Five has been discontinued.  Our burn rate (TM) was higher than anticipated due to webscale scaling.

* For better startup saitre, see [Vooza](http://vooza.com/).
